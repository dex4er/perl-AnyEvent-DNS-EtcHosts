NAME
    AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts - Use /etc/hosts before DNS

SYNOPSIS
      use AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts;
      use AnyEvent::DNS;

      my $guard = AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts->register;
      my $cv = AE::cv;

      AnyEvent::DNS::any 'example.com', sub {
          say foreach map { $_->[4] } grep { $_->[1] =~ /^(a|aaaa)$/ } @_;
          $cv->send;
      };

    undef $guard;

DESCRIPTION
    AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts changes AnyEvent::DNS behavior. The /etc/hosts
    file is searched before DNS, so it is possible to override DNS entries.

    The DNS lookup are emulated so this resolver returns the standard DNS
    reply based on /etc/hosts file rather than real DNS.

SEE ALSO
    AnyEvent::DNS, AnyEvent::Socket.
